# Stock-Market-Real-Time-Data-Analysis-Using-Kafka
## Introduction
Welcome to the Real-Time Stock Market Data Engineering Project! This project demonstrates an end-to-end data engineering solution for processing and analyzing live stock market data using a variety of technologies, including Python, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Apache Kafka, AWS Glue, Athena, and SQL.

## Project Overview
In this repository, you'll find the complete source code and configuration files to set up a robust and scalable real-time data processing pipeline. The architecture involves:

* Apache Kafka: A distributed event streaming platform for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications.

* Python: Utilized for data processing tasks, Kafka producer/consumer implementation, and other custom functionalities.

* Amazon Web Services (AWS): The project leverages AWS services for cloud-based data storage, processing, and analysis.

* AWS Glue: A fully managed extract, transform, and load (ETL) service that makes it easy to prepare and load data for analysis.

* Amazon Athena: An interactive query service that allows you to analyze data in Amazon S3 using standard SQL.
